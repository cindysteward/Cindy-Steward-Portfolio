# Welcome to my Porfolio!

Hi! I'm Cindy, and this is my portfolio for my coding and learning projects as I study Python, Matlab, Machine Learning and XCode / Swift.
Some key features of this portfolio are:
1. Some of my finished projects, either through university or in my free time.
2. Short projects to learn a new command or process.
3. Analyzing a code and tweaking it to understand the mechanics of the code.

Thank you for taking a look!
