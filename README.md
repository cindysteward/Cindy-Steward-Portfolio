# Welcome to my Porfolio!

Hi! I'm Cindy, and this is my portfolio for my coding and computer science projects as I study Python, MATLAB, Machine Learning and AI.
Some key features of this portfolio are:
1. Finished projects I have done in my free time.
2. Assignments completed through my education and university courses.
3. Projects based on a source to learn new mechanics and possibilities.

Thank you for taking a look!
