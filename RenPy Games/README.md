This folder contains projects I have done using RenPy: https://www.renpy.org/latest.html
RenPy is used for visual novels and story-telling.
RenPy's screen language allows the creation of complex interfaces, while its support for the Python scripting language allows for complex game logic.
To play this game, RenPy must be downloaded and the folder must be downloaded and placed within the downloaded RenPy folder.
